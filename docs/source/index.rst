Welcome to inattrail's documentation!
=====================================

*Inattrail* reads the route of a hike and generates a
table of iNaturalist observations along the way. It also displays the
observations and the route of the hike on a map. It also stores waypoints of
the iNaturalist observations for offline navigation with a GPS device or
smartphone.
